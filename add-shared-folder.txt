Enabling shared folders
-----------------------
Run the command below as root :

sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-utils

Once completed, exit the terminal.

Now open your file explorer :

You will see your shared folder but with the string “sf_” added at the beginning.

If you click on the shared folder you will most likely see the error message.

In order to access the shared folders, you would need to add your user to a group called vboxsf (there are users and groups). Open up your terminal and run the command below :

sudo adduser [username] vboxsf

Now enter the command :

sudo reboot

And access again your shared folder. You will be able to create/delete/change files.
