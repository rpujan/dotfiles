di             delete inside

dl    delete character (alias: "x")   |dl|
diw   delete inner word           		*diw*
daw   delete a word               		*daw*
diW   delete inner WORD (see |WORD|)  *diW*
daW   delete a WORD (see |WORD|)      *daW*
dd    delete one line                 |dd|
dis   delete inner sentence           *dis*
das   delete a sentence           		*das*
dib   delete inner '(' ')' block      *dib*
dab   delete a '(' ')' block          *dab*
dip   delete inner paragraph          *dip*

diB   delete inner '{' '}' block      *diB*
daB   delete a '{' '}' block          *daB*

Note the difference between using a movement command and an object.  The
movement command operates from here (cursor position) to where the movement
takes us.  When using an object the whole object is operated upon, no matter
where on the object the cursor is.  For example, compare "dw" and "daw": "dw"
deletes from the cursor position to the start of the next word, "daw" deletes
the word under the cursor and the space after or before it.

these commands to easily switch between buffers:
-----------------------------------------------
:bf            # Go to first file.
:bl            # Go to last file
:bn            # Go to next file.
:bp            # Go to previous file.
:b number      # Go to n'th file (E.g :b 2)
:bw            # Close current file.
:buffers or :ls or :files # list of all opened buffers

Jumping back and forth in Normal mode
-------------------------------------
Ctrl+o   navigate to the previous location in the jump list (think o as old)
Ctrl+i   navigate to the next location in the jump list (i and o are usually next to each other)
g;       go to the previous change location
g,       go to the newer change location
gi       place the cursor at the same position where it was left last time in the Insert mode

Use :jumps to view the jumps list.

Search word nearest to the cursor
---------------------------------
* : searches the word nearest to the cursor in the forward direction (matches only the whole word)
# : searches the word nearest to the cursor in the backward direction (matches only the whole word)

g* : searches the word nearest to the cursor in the forward direction (matches as part of another word as well)
g# : searches the word nearest to the cursor in the backward direction (matches as part of another word as well)

Move screen without moving cursor
---------------------------------
Ctrl-y Moves screen up one line
Ctrl-e Moves screen down one line
Ctrl-u Moves cursor & screen up ½ page
Ctrl-d Moves cursor & screen down ½ page
Ctrl-b Moves screen up one page, cursor to last line
Ctrl-f Moves screen down one page, cursor to first line

Ctrl-y and Ctrl-e only change the cursor position if it would be moved off screen.

Suspend and resume
------------------
Ctrl+Z : to suspend vim and go back to shell
fg     : resume

Copy Paste
----------
Copy: ya{([ or yi{([
move: 3j
paste: viw or viW

Advanced Features:

VS Code (with Vim enabled):
---------------------------
Ctrl + ` : Focus terminal windows
Ctrl + 1 : Focus code windows
Ctrl + Shift + e : Move between file explorer windows and editor windows
Ctrl + n : Create new file in file explorer windows.
Ctrl + Shift + n : Create a new folder in file explorer windows.
gt    : Next tab
gT    : Previous tab
nnngt : Numbered tab

Text Files
----------
:set wrap           : Justify text
:set wrap linebreak : Left align text
), (                : Jump forward/backward one sentence.
}, {                : Jump forward/backward one paragraph.

format file (indentation)
-------------------------
The master of all commands:
gg=G

To indent the all the lines below the current line:
=G

To indent the current line:
==

To indent 'n' lines below the current line:
n==
for example, to indent 4 lines below the current line:
4==

To indent a block of code, go to one of the brackes and  use command:
=%

Different ways to get into insert mode
--------------------------------------
There are different ways to get into insert mode besides i. Here are some of them:

i      " insert text before cursor
I      " insert text before the first non-blank character of the line.
a      " append text after cursor
A      " append text at the end of line
o      " starts a new line below cursor and insert text
O      " starts a new line above cursor and insert text
gi     " insert text in same position where last insert mode was stopped in current buffer
gI     " insert text at the start of line (column 1)

Repeating Insert Mode
---------------------
You can give a count before you enter insert mode. For example:
10i

Then if you type "hello world!" and exit insert mode, it will repeat the text "hello world!" 10 times. 
This works with any methods you use to enter insert mode (10I, 11a, 12o)

Deleting chunks in insert mode
------------------------------
There are different ways to delete while in insert mode besides <backspace>:
Ctrl-h      " delete one character
Ctrl-w      " delete one word
Ctrl-u      " delete entire line

i: insert before the cursor
a: append after the cursor
I: insert at the beginning of the line
A: append at the end of the line
o: open a new line below the current one
O: open a new line above the current one
r: replace the one character under your cursor
R: replace the character under your cursor, but just keep typing afterwards
cm: change whatever you define as a movement, e.g. a word, or a sentence, or a paragraph.
C: change the current line from where you’re at
ct?: change change up to the question mark
s: substitute from where you are to the next command (noun)
S: substitute the entire current line


Marking Position
----------------
You can use marks to save your current position and return to this position later. 
It's like a bookmark for text editing. You can set a mark with mx, where x can be any 
alphabetical letter a-zA-Z. There are two ways to return to mark: exact (line and column) 
with  `x and linewise ('x).

ma    Mark position with mark "a"
`a    Jump to line and column "a"
'a    Jump to line "a"

There is a difference between marking with lowercase letters (a-z) and uppercase letters (A-Z). 
Lowercase alphabets are local marks and uppercase alphabets are global marks (sometimes known as file marks).

Let's talk about local marks. Each buffer can have its own set of local marks. 
If I have two files opened, I can set a mark "a" (ma) in the first file and another mark "a" (ma) 
in the second file.

Unlike local marks where you can have a set of marks in each buffer, you only get one set of 
global marks. If you set mA inside myFile.txt, the next time you run mA in a different file, 
it will overwrite the first "A" mark. One advantage of global marks is you can jump to any global 
mark even if you are inside a completely different project. Global marks can travel across files.

To view all marks, use :marks. You may notice from the marks list there are more marks other 
than a-zA-Z. Some of them are:

''    Jump back to the last line in current buffer before jump
``    Jump back to the last position in current buffer before jump
`[    Jump to beginning of previously changed / yanked text
`]    Jump to the ending of previously changed / yanked text
`<    Jump to the beginning of last visual selection
`>    Jump to the ending of last visual selection
`0    Jump back to the last edited file when exiting vim

Vim As a Merge Tool
-------------------
First, change the default merge tool to use vimdiff by running:

git config merge.tool vimdiff
git config merge.conflictstyle diff3
git config mergetool.prompt false

Resolve the conflict using our newly-configured mergetool. Run:

git mergetool

Vim displays four windows. Pay attention to the top three:

LOCA   This is the change in "local", what you are merging into.
BASE   This is the common ancestor between LOCAL and REMOTE to compare how they diverge.
REMOTE This is what is being merged into.

At the bottom (the fourth window):

The fourth window contains the merge conflict texts. With this setup, it is easier to 
see what change each environment has. You can see the content from LOCAL, BASE, and REMOTE 
at the same time.

Your cursor should be on the fourth windows, on the highlighted area. 
To get the change from LOCAL (grapes), run :diffget LOCAL. 
To get the change from BASE (oranges), run :diffget BASE and 
To get the change from REMOTE (apples), run :diffget REMOTE.
