First of all, you need to install Vim or Neovim, preferably with +python3 support enabled.

Also, you need to have git and curl installed in your system, which are needed for downloading plugins and fonts.

curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash
After SpaceVim is installed, launch nvim or vim, all plugins will be downloaded automatically.
